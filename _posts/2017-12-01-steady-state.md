The history of environmentalist thought is structured, as often as not, by too
much and too many: too much stuff, too many people; too much deforestation, too
many poisoned aquifers. Capitalism, as its supporters and critics alike would
surely agree, thrives on exactly this too-muchness. Growth is its sole
commandment.

It hardly needs to be said that these truths can’t coexist, that a system that
needs to keep growing to survive is ill suited to a full planet running rapidly
out of resources. The doctrine of endless growth, which must ignore this fact,
requires an ecological illiteracy best summed up by America’s
Illiterate-in-Chief in an interview he gave to Fox News’s Chris Wallace: “We’ll
be fine with the environment. We can leave a little bit, but you can’t destroy
business.”

Trump is no economist, but he articulates a perspective on the environment that
pervades standard economics—that you can just “leave a little bit,” or not even
bother to, and the economy will continue to grow, as though the environment
were not the source and limit of all value. To conceive of a robust economy
without growth, you have to break from the most fundamental premises of
economic thought, to come up with a new standard for what makes an economy
successful.

Herman Daly proposed just such a revolution decades ago with his concept of
“steady-state economics,” which takes as its starting point the question that
economists before him studiously declined to ask: “how big the economy should
be relative to the ecosystem.” Now, when we may need it most, n+1 co-founder
Benjamin Kunkel is attempting to reintroduce Daly’s steady-state economics back
into popular circulation with a reissue of his 1987 essay, “On the Steady
State.”...
